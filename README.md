##About MAEC

Malware Attribute Enumeration and Characterization (MAECâ„¢) is a standardized language for sharing structured information about malware based upon attributes such as behaviors, artifacts, and attack patterns.

The goal of the MAEC (pronounced "mike") effort is to provide a basis for transforming malware research and response. MAEC aims to eliminate the ambiguity and inaccuracy that currently exists in malware descriptions and to reduce reliance on signatures. In this way, MAEC seeks to improve human-to-human, human-to-tool, tool-to-tool, and tool-to-human communication about malware; reduce potential duplication of malware analysis efforts by researchers; and allow for the faster development of countermeasures by enabling the ability to leverage responses to previously observed malware instances. The MAEC Language enables correlation, integration, and automation.
