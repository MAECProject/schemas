			<short_description>The following defines types for default controlled vocabularies used within MAEC. An individual vocabulary may be revised at any time. Revisions to vocabularies will result in the creation of new types with the new version number embedded in the name of those types. Vocabularies can be reference from MAEC elements through the use of xsi:Type. The individual elements where this may be done indicate the expected default vocabulary.</short_description>
