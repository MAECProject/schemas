Actions do not contain any associated context as to why they were performed, as this level of detail and abstraction is documented by Behaviors. Examples of Actions include the creation of a particular file on disk and the opening of a port. Actions are commonly captured and reported by dynamic malware analysis tools (e.g., sandboxes).",
