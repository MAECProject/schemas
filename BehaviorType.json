Behaviors can be thought of as representing the purpose behind groups of MAEC Actions, and are therefore representative of distinct portions of higher-level malware functionality. Thus, while a malware instance may perform some multitude of Actions, it is likely that these Actions represent only a few distinct behaviors. Some examples include vulnerability exploitation, email address harvesting, the disabling of a security service, etc.",
